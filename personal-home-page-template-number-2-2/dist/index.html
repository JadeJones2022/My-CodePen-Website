   <p id=coding ><strong> Why do I want to learn to code? </strong></p>
  <p>I am learning to code because I believe that web 3.0 will change the world. We have recently seen in coronavirus how technology is changing the way that people work. I believe that the next five years will change the way that we work, we interact with each other and the way that we live.Billions of dollars are currently being invested into the metaverse and large corporations are building apps and software ready for when the metaverse is part of mainstream culture.</p>
  <p> I have an interest in cryptocurrencies and have seen how technological advances have meant that marginalised people are now able to access banking and identities through the blockchain. When I discuss these things with friends they have little interest in the underlying technologies but I find them fascinating. This is why I have made the decision to pursue a career in web development.</p>
  <p id=about> <strong>About me</strong> </p>
  <p> I know that it is going to be a challenge to learn to code, but I love to solve problems, which I think will be a positive thing during the next few months. I know that it is going to be hard work, as I am learning a new language, and some things will take time to understand, but I am looking forward to undertaking the challenge. I have not studied much since university, so I think it will take a while to get into the routine again, but I am looking forward to it. </p>
